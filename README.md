<h1>Linear Regression</h2>
</p>

  Here is the code for **How to Make a Prediction - Intro to Deep Learning.** The goal is to predict an animal's body weight given its brain weight. The model we'll be using is called [Linear Regression](http://www.statisticssolutions.com/what-is-linear-regression/). The dataset we're using to train our model consists of brain weight and body weight measurements from various animals. We'll fit our line to the data using the scikit-learn machine learning library, and then plot our graph using matplotlib.

![Pandas](https://img.shields.io/badge/pandas-%23150458.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=pandas&logoColor=white)
![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/scikit--learn-%23F7931E.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)

You can simply run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the terminal to install the necessary dependencies. If you don't already have pip, here is a link to install it [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).

### Usage

Type `python demo.py` into the terminal, and you'll see the scatter plot and line of best fit appear.

*Note: Bonus points if you perform linear regression on a dataset with three different variables.*
